# Terraform Project

## Overview
This project uses Terraform to manage infrastructure as code. Terraform allows you to define and provision data center infrastructure using a high-level configuration language.

## Features
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform
- Automated provisioning and management of cloud resources
- Version control for infrastructure configurations
- Support for multiple cloud providers

## Directory Structure
- `main.tf`: Main configuration file for defining resources
- `variables.tf`: File for defining input variables
- `outputs.tf`: File for defining output values
- `terraform.tfvars`: File for providing values to variables
- `.terraform/`: Local directory for Terraform state and cache
- `*.tfstate`: State files for tracking resource states
- `*.tfplan`: Plan files for storing execution plans

## Getting Started
1. **Install Terraform**: Follow the instructions on the [Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) to install Terraform.
2. **Initialize the project**: Run `terraform init` to initialize the project.
3. **Plan the infrastructure**: Run `terraform plan` to see the changes that will be made.
4. **Apply the configuration**: Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes and provision the resources.

## Prerequisites
- Terraform v0.12 or higher
- Access to the cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Customize the `variables.tf` and `terraform.tfvars` files with your specific values.
4. Follow the steps in the Getting Started section to provision the infrastructure.
